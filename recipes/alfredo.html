        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fettuccine Alfredo is a pasta dish consisting of fettuccine tossed with butter 
            and Parmesan cheese, which melt and emulsify to form a rich cheese sauce coating 
            the pasta. Originating in Rome in the early 20th century, the recipe is now popular 
            in the United States and other countries. Outside of Italy, cream is sometimes 
            used to thicken the sauce, and ingredients such as chicken, shrimp, salmon or 
            broccoli may also be added when it is served as a main course.

            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, 
                and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.

                While pasta is cooking, melt cream cheese and butter in a skillet 
                over low heat. Stir until smooth. Stir in milk, and season with garlic 
                powder, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 3 minutes, or until thickened, 
                stirring constantly.
