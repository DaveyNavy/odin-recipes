        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            An emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served with 
            tomato sauce, which may contain various herbs (especially oregano and basil), 
            olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include 
            amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as pecorino romano, 
            Parmesan, and Grana Padano, are often sprinkled on top.
